## Getting started
Let's get started using BarChart.js!
First, we need to have a div with class "chart" in our page.

```html
<div id="chart"> </div>
```
After that we need to include JavaScript file in our page. To make that we have to download the "main.bundle.js" from this github repository and include it before the closing ```html </body> ``` tag
