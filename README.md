# BarChart.js
## Introduction
BarChart.js is a vanilla js library for creating simple bar charts.
The main purpose of this library is to quickly create simple customizable bar charts without any difficulties.
## Getting started
Let's get started using BarChart.js!
First, we need to have a div with class "chart" in our page.

```html
<div id="chart"> </div>
```

After that we need to include JavaScript file in our page. To make that we have to download the "main.bundle.js" from this github repository and include it before the closing ``` </body> ``` tag

Now we want to draw a new chart using our data. BarChart.js creates charts based on json data, like this :

```
{
 "Luke": 34,
 "Mary": 14,
 "Kally": 28,
 "Duran": 19,
 "Emily": 13,
 "Bob": 41,
}
```
